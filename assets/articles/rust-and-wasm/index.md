# Exploring Rust and WASM

Rust's powerful type system and performance characteristics make it an excellent choice for compiling to WebAssembly.

## Benefits

1.  **Performance**: WASM runs at near-native speed.
2.  **Safety**: Rust's memory safety guarantees extend to the web.
3.  **Ecosystem**: Crates like Dioxus make web development ergonomic.
